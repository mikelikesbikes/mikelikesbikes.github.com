Today, Jim Weirich – a legend in the Ruby community – passed away. Jim was a humble, kind, and patient man and a source of so much positivity in our community. I want to tell you a story about how Jim came into my life.

In 2009, I attended Ruby Hoedown in Nashville, Tennessee. It was my first Ruby conference. I arrived at the conference hotel brimming with enthusiasm. I was excited for the opportunity to meet new people, discuss tech stuff, and dig my heels into this community.

The first day started off spectacularly. I sat in talk after talk about testing in Ruby and debugging in Ruby and cool Rails stuff. I even remember a mind blowing talk about performance tuning Ruby at the assembler level. I was in the presence of the most passionate programmers I'd ever met. But, as the day came to an end my enthusiasm had turned to something else.

I left the conference area just before the last talk began. I headed back to my hotel room to call my then fiancee, Emily. Within minutes, I was crying uncontrollably. I had never felt like such an outsider. I'd been doing Ruby professionally for a month. It seemed to me at the time that I would never catch up to these people. Imposter syndrome had crept up on me and had decided to strike while I was most vulnerable. Emily tried to reassure me – she's been in similar situations. But in the moment I couldn't move past how alone I felt.

When I finished talking to Emily, I headed to dinner with some friends from Edgecase. At the time Edgecase was the top Ruby shop in Columbus, Ohio. It was the shop I wanted to work for when I was good at Ruby. We were joined by a few  noteable Ruby "celebrities", among them were David Chelimsky (inventor of RSpec) and Jim Weirich (inventor of Rake). I tried to introduce myself, but I was still shaken up from earlier, so I ate quickly and headed back to my hotel room.

I sat in my bed for a while. My mind was racing. "What the hell am I doing in this community?!" I asked myself. I tried desperately to remember what Emily had said to me earlier, and as I went to sleep that night I promised myself that tomorrow would be a new day.

I woke up to the sun beaming into our windows, and it felt like a new day. I got dressed and headed out to find breakfast with some new folks before the conference resumed. I ended up meeting a few new people and had good conversation while munching on pastries and sipping a cup of coffee. Things were looking up.

We headed back towards the conference room a little late, so the only seats were at the back of the packed room. I sat down at the first open seat I saw. To my surprise I had found two people I knew from Edgecase. A few minutes later, Jim Weirich, also an Edgecase guy sat down in the seat next to me.

For a brief second, all of the thoughts from the previous day rushed back. I was barely able to concentrate on the talk as my mind wrestled with how to deal with what I was feeling. After the first talk, everyone at the table started talking – about shop, about programming, about the previous night. It helped me recenter myself, and I was again ready to face the day.

The second talk of the day (IIRC) was David Chelimsky. The whole conference, myself included, had been waiting for this talk. All eyes were on David as he began speaking.

I remember very distinctly that about 15 minutes in, I heard Jim make a sound; the sound of a new insight, that "mmmhmmm" where you just cracked a problem, and you can't wait to implement it. Jim grabbed a napkin and began writing feverishly. My attention returned to David's talk. I was amazed by all of the cool tools he was exposing us to. As the talk concluded, I looked back to Jim. I don't think he'd looked back up from his napkin in the previous 30 minutes.

After the applause died down, and we returned to our seats, Jim looked at me – a person he'd met only once in passing, a person who had been programming ruby for only a month, a person who was grappling with belonging. He slid the napkin toward me, and with that Jim Weirich twinkle, said "What do you think?"

He waited patiently as I tried desperately to read the pseudocode he'd written on the napkin. About 2 minutes later, which seemed like an eternity, I responded "this is really interesting."

What Jim had slid me was the first draft of what would eventually become Jim's rspec-given extension.

What struck me in the moment after this was a humility that I'd never experienced before. This man – a man who gave us rake, who contributed to rubygems, and who spoke nationally about ruby and programming – had asked me, ME, what I thought. There was no ego in his voice. He genuinely wanted to hear what I thought. 

Jim could have easily dismissed me as a child sitting at the adults table. But he didn't. He waited while I read the code, and he dug deeper into my thoughts when I'd finally answered. 

He was curious in an enlightened way. He truely believed that insights could come from anywhere.

In the years that followed, I hung out with Jim at work and at conferences. Jim's character never stopped amazing me. He'd give a talk on the Y-Combinator, then go play his ukelele with some other musicians, then he'd be at a vendor table genuinely engaging the people manning the tables (he manned the EdgeCase table often), then you might find him playing D&D or drinking a scotch and enjoying the company and story of friends.

This man, with all his humility, kindness, and generosity made everyone around him stand a little taller. Believe in the magic of the unknown.

We all have a lifetime of lessons to learn from the way that Jim interacted with others. Jim's impact was as fulfilling as his laughter, which still echoes in my head.

Jim will be missed very dearly by those who knew him.
